Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, Mexico was the team with the lowest chance of winning, but when the simulations increased, the team with the lowest chance of winning was actually Japan.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think that after 10000 simulations the predictions are good enough, because with more simulations than 10000 the same ranks and chances keeps showing up. Also, the time that 10000 simulations takes to run is good.
