If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I'd say that it is sometimes a calm aura and sometimes an electric aura.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I think that using an AI (Artificial Intelligence) would be better, because it would make a better job describing the listener aura.
